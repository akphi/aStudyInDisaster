# Conclusion {#conclusion}

In this research, we attempted to answer the question **"How do various demographic and socioeconomic factors affect chance of survival in shipwreck where the ship's capacity is at least 1000 passegners and the route is through the Atlantic Ocean in the early 20^th^ century?"** and we have found a not-so-surprising result that women, children, and first class passengers have better chance of survival. Besides, there is an interesting finding we found that people with more siblings and spouses are less likely to survive.

As mentioned, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test p-value for the final model is very low (7.114e-06); this suggests a lack of fit in the model. This might also hint on the fact that generalized linear model might not be the best approach to answer the research question, and thus, we should try out different modelling methods. Again, as mentioned before, AIC value only suggests if a model is relatively better than another but does not provide an absolute scale to estimate how well a model performs. Also, among the explanatory variables used in the model, `age` has approximately 20\% missing data; this adds unnecessary complexity in the model and thus could have affected the performance of the model. Another limitation is that we only build the model but did not really test it against real data; what we could have done is to split the data into training and testing groups, but that is out of the scope of the class and the project. If we can run the model against test samples, we will have a much better sense of how the model perform. 

Another point to note is that we only have access to information of 1300/2200 passengers on the Titanic; hence, our data might not have reflected the true demographics and socioeconomic settings of all passengers on the ship. We are not so sure why there are many people missing. If these people are majorly male labor and third-class passengers, our findings might not been affected much. But if many of these are rich people who tried to keep their identity hidden for example or they all did not survived the shipwreck (so that we do not have any information about them), then definitely our model could not generalize well.

We also consider some opportunities for further studies, which includes splitting the data set by gender and come up with models for each part of the data to see whether we can come up with models with better diagnostic results for each gender. We are considering splitting the children group (age 0-5) based on their passenger classes to see if first class children have higher rate of survival. The only problem is that the sample size might be too small and also there are a lot of missing data for age.

To conclude, out of curiosity, we attempt to reimagine the night of the disaster, putting ourselves in the shoes of those tragic passengers. As one-score-and-two male who are properly only rich enough to get a third-class ticket on the Titanic, we realize our inevitable fate. We will go down with the ship, as the saying goes...
