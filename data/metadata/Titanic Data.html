    <h1>Titanic Data</h1>

<p>
   The <tt>titanic</tt> and <tt>titanic2</tt> data frames describe
        the survival status of individual passengers on the
        Titanic. The <tt>titanic</tt> data
        frame does not contain information from the crew, but it
        does contain actual ages of half of the passengers.
		The principal source for data about Titanic passengers is the
		<a href="http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/"><i>Encyclopedia
        Titanica</i></a>.  The datasets used here were begun
		by a variety of researchers.  One of the original sources is
		Eaton &amp; Haas (1994) <i>Titanic:
        Triumph and Tragedy</i>, Patrick Stephens Ltd, which includes
        a passenger list created by many researchers and edited by
        Michael A. Findlay.
		</p><p>
        The variables on our extracted dataset are pclass, survived,
        name, age, embarked, 
        home.dest, room, ticket, boat, and sex. pclass refers to
        passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd), and is a proxy for socio-economic
        class. Age is in years, and some infants had fractional
        values. The <tt>titanic2</tt> data frame has no missing data and
        includes records for the crew, but age is dichotomized at
        adult vs. child.  These data were obtained from 
		<a href="http://www2.ncsu.edu/ncsu/pams/stat/info/jse/v3n3/datasets.dawson.html">Robert
        Dawson</a>, Saint Mary's University, 
		<a href="mailto:rdawson@husky1.stmarys.ca">E-mail</a>. The
        variables are pclass, age, sex, survived. These data
        frames are useful for demonstrating many of the functions
        in <tt>Hmisc</tt> as well as demonstrating binary logistic
        regression analysis using the Design library. For more
        details and references see Simonoff, Jeffrey S (1997):
        The "unusual episode" and a second statistics
        course. <i>J Statistics Education</i>, 
		<a href="http://www2.ncsu.edu/ncsu/pams/stat/info/jse/v5n1">Vol.
        5 No. 1</a>.<br><br>
		Thomas Cason of UVa has greatly updated and improved the
        <tt>titanic</tt> data frame using the <i>Encyclopedia
        Titanica</i> and created a new dataset called
	  <tt>titanic3</tt>.<br>
       These datasets
        reflects the state of data available as of 2 August 1999.
        Some duplicate passengers have 
        been dropped, many errors corrected, many missing ages filled
        in, and new variables created.  Click <a href="http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/titanic3info.txt">here</a> for information about how this
        datatset was constructed.
		<br><br>
        An interesting result may be obtained using functions
        from the <tt>Hmisc</tt> library
